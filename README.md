# Confero - An aid for need
---
### We Gayathri R and Sridhar Rao K developed the following project which is powered by Tezos.
---

## Confero is a Tezos blockchain based and Artificial Intelligence enabled Fundraising Platform.

 *This platform is for the ones who are in need of funds to pay for medical bills to cure Brain Tumor.*
 
 *Anyone can be a fundraiser on Confero if they have scanning image of Brain Tumor.*
 
 >**Why scanning image of patient is needed ?**
 
 >*Because this platform is AI enabled means the image will be used to predict whether the patient really affected with brain tumor or not and it will accept/deny user's fundraising request without any human intervention*
 
### How this works ?

 *1.User need to connect Tezos based  wallet to Confero by opening Tezos clicking on following link [Confero](https://www.google.com)* 
 
 *2.Create profile in order to manage their fundraisings and donations*
 
 *3.User can click on Start a FundRaiser to Raise fundraiser request, and user need to give the details of the patient and brain scanning image in order to be predicted and approved by the system using Machine Learning*
 
 *4.*
